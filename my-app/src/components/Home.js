        <p>Nothing makes decluttering easier than knowing your clothes are going to a worthy cause â€” or at the very least, not going to the dump. Consider this: Around 11 million tons of textile waste ends up in landfills each year. And your old jeans and tees don't have a short stay there either. Depending on the material, it could take them anywhere from several weeks to several decades to break down, releasing methane, a greenhouse gas more potent than carbon dioxide, in the process. Fortunately, there are simple ways you can donate your clothes to save the planet, and at the same time, help those in need.</p>
